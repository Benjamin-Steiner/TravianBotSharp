## Features
#### - Auto-Change proxy
TBS can change proxy by itself. This means you are far less likely to be banned for using a bot. Main reason for a bot ban is high activity from same IP (12h+). TBS supports proxy authentication.
#### - Auto-Settle new villages
TBS can find appropriate valleys to settle around your capital village. Or you can input coordinates in advance and it will automatically settle one valley after another.
#### - Auto-Fill troops and send resources to/from capital
TBS will automatically send resources from capital village to off/deff villages, train troops there and send the remaining resources back. This is a perfect feature for any deff account.
#### - Attack/Fake at specific time with multiple waves and oasis farming for T4.6
Dream-come-true for any offensive player.

#### Tech specification
It's a Windows Forms app written in C#. It only works on Windows. My plan is to make a web app for the frontend and I have already ported the TBS Core to the .Net Standard, so it could be used by .Net core project (cross-platform option).
